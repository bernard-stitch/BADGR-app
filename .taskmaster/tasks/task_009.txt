# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Widget Placement Options
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive widget placement system that allows merchants to choose from six detailed placement options on the product page, including Product Page Top, Product Page Bottom, Near Add to Cart, Product Tabs, Sidebar, and Floating Widget. This system includes detailed descriptions and impact assessments for each placement, a visual preview system with modal dialogs showing layout mockups, and an interactive radio button selection with visual feedback.
# Details:
The implementation features color-coded badges (Recommended, Popular, High Converting) and live preview functionality for placement options. The user interface is built with Polaris components and complies with accessibility standards. The main component is PlacementSelector.js, which provides comprehensive placement visualization and user guidance.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the selected placement option is saved correctly and displayed in the admin UI. Additionally, ensure that the visual previews and impact assessments are accurate and accessible.
