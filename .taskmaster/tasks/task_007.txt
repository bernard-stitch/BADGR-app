# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Logo Selection Feature
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Allow merchants to select logos from a predefined library. Implementation is complete with a fully functional logo selection component.
# Details:
Created a PredefinedLogoSelector.js component that displays a library of 7 BNPL provider logos (Affirm, Klarna, Afterpay, Sezzle, Zip, PayPal Credit, Generic BNPL) with a category filtering system and an interactive grid layout. The logos are integrated with professional Polaris UI, and SVG logo assets are stored in `/public/logos/`. The WidgetSettings.js has been updated to replace the file upload LogoSelector with the PredefinedLogoSelector, updating state management and save logic accordingly.

# Test Strategy:
Test the logo selection process by ensuring the selected logo is saved and displayed correctly in the admin UI. Verify that the logo selection works as specified in the original requirements and that all logos are displayed with their respective descriptions and status badges.
