Here's the comprehensive implementation approach for the Theme App Extension:\n\n## Research Findings:\n\n### 1. Theme App Extension Structure\n- **Extension Type**: Theme app extension for widget injection\n- **Target**: Product pages using app blocks\n- **Framework**: Uses Shopify CLI 3.0+ with TOML configuration\n- **File Structure**:\n  - `/extensions/theme-app-extension/`\n    - `shopify.extension.toml` - Configuration file\n    - `blocks/` - Liquid files for app blocks\n    - `assets/` - CSS, JS, and static content\n    - `snippets/` - Reusable Liquid components\n    - `locales/` - Translation files\n\n### 2. App Block Configuration\n- **Block Type**: App block for product pages (`target: \"section\"`)\n- **Template Support**: Product pages using JSON templates\n- **Integration**: Merchants add blocks via theme editor\n- **Settings**: Configurable via schema in block files\n\n### 3. Implementation Strategy\n\n#### Phase 1: Extension Setup\n1. **Generate Extension**: `shopify app generate extension --template theme_app_extension`\n2. **Configure TOML**: Set up `shopify.extension.toml` with:\n   - Extension name and description\n   - Block targeting for product pages\n   - Asset references (CSS/JS)\n   - Merchant-configurable settings\n\n#### Phase 2: Widget Integration\n1. **Create App Block**: `blocks/bnpl-widget.liquid`\n   - Fetch widget configuration from API\n   - Render BNPL options based on settings\n   - Include conditional logic for different payment providers\n   - Support for logo display and placement options\n\n2. **Asset Development**: \n   - `assets/bnpl-widget.css` - Styling\n   - `assets/bnpl-widget.js` - Interactive functionality\n   - Logo assets for different BNPL providers\n\n#### Phase 3: Configuration Schema\n```liquid\n{% schema %}\n{\n  \"name\": \"BNPL Widget\",\n  \"target\": \"section\",\n  \"enabled_on\": {\n    \"templates\": [\"product\"]\n  },\n  \"settings\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"text\",\n      \"id\": \"widget_title\",\n      \"label\": \"Widget Title\",\n      \"default\": \"Buy Now, Pay Later Options\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"select\",\n      \"id\": \"placement\",\n      \"label\": \"Placement\",\n      \"options\": [\n        {\"value\": \"price\", \"label\": \"Near Price\"},\n        {\"value\": \"cart\", \"label\": \"Add to Cart\"},\n        {\"value\": \"description\", \"label\": \"Product Description\"}\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n{% endschema %}\n```\n\n### 4. API Integration\n- **Widget Configuration**: Fetch from backend API (`/api/widgets`)\n- **Dynamic Content**: Use Liquid to access product data\n- **Conditional Rendering**: Show/hide based on product eligibility\n\n### 5. Theme Compatibility\n- **Online Store 2.0**: Full support with app blocks\n- **Legacy Themes**: Fallback to custom liquid sections\n- **Verification**: Use Admin API to check theme support\n\n### 6. Testing Strategy\n- **Development Store**: Test with generated test data\n- **Theme Editor**: Verify block placement and configuration\n- **Product Pages**: Test widget appearance and functionality\n- **Different Themes**: Ensure compatibility across theme types\n\n### 7. Deployment Process\n1. **Build Extension**: `shopify app build`\n2. **Deploy Version**: `shopify app deploy`\n3. **Release**: Create app version with extension\n4. **Merchant Installation**: Theme editor integration\n\nThis comprehensive approach leverages all the MCP tools research to ensure proper implementation following Shopify's best practices and guidelines.\n</info added on 2025-07-12T14:19:00.137Z>",
