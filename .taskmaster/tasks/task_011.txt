Successfully pushed project to GitHub repository at https://github.com/bernard-stitch/BADGR-app. This preserves all current work including the complete backend API implementation with Node.js and Express, Supabase integration for configuration storage, React frontend with Polaris UI components, complete admin interface for widget management, theme app extension files for Shopify integration, all BNPL provider configurations and logo assets, and the widget rendering foundation with JavaScript and CSS. The repository is now set up with proper security (API keys removed from version control) and is ready for collaborative development. All Tasks 1-10 are preserved in the repository, and Task 11 is in progress.

Successfully completed the widget rendering script implementation:

✅ **Backend API Integration:**
- Added POST /api/widgets/:widgetId/options endpoint to return BNPL options based on product data
- Implemented generateBNPLOptions() function with full provider configurations for all 6 BNPL providers

- Added tracking endpoint POST /api/widgets/track for analytics
- Implemented proper error handling and shop domain detection

✅ **JavaScript Widget Enhancement:**
- Updated API base URL detection to support development (localhost) and production environments
- Fixed tracking endpoint URL to match backend routing
- Improved error handling and response processing

✅ **Logo Asset Management:**
- Copied all BNPL provider logos to theme extension assets folder
- Updated backend API to serve logos from proper theme extension asset URLs
- Ensured logos are accessible for all 6 providers (Klarna, Afterpay, Affirm, Sezzle, Zip, PayPal Credit)

✅ **Provider Configuration:**
- Implemented full provider eligibility rules with realistic price ranges
- Added proper installment calculations (4 payments for most, 3 for Affirm, 6 for PayPal Credit)

## 2. Integrate API for Widget Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Connect the widget rendering logic to the existing RESTful API for fetching widget configurations.
### Details:
Ensure that the rendering logic correctly interacts with the API to retrieve the necessary configuration data.
<info added on 2025-07-13T04:25:09.343Z>
Successfully integrated API for widget configuration:

✅ **Dynamic Configuration Loading:**
- Added loadWidgetConfiguration() method to fetch configuration from API before rendering
- Implemented shop domain lookup in backend API (supports both shop ID and domain)
- Added fallback behavior: uses template settings if API call fails

✅ **Configuration Merging:**
- Created seamless integration between API configuration and Liquid template settings
- API configuration takes precedence over template settings when available
- Proper handling of enabled providers from both sources (array and comma-separated string)

✅ **Backend API Enhancement:**
- Updated GET /api/widgets/:shopId to handle both shop ID and domain lookups
- Added proper error handling for configuration retrieval
- Ensured configuration can be retrieved by shop domain (needed for theme extension)

✅ **Widget State Management:**
- Added parseEnabledProviders() method to handle different data formats
- Proper updating of widget instance properties from API configuration
- Widget automatically hides if disabled via API configuration

✅ **Debug and Monitoring:**
- Added console logging for configuration loading verification
- Proper error handling and fallback to template settings
- Graceful degradation when API is unavailable

The widget now successfully integrates with the backend API to fetch dynamic configuration while maintaining compatibility with static template settings.

## 3. Implement Placement Handling Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Develop logic to handle different placements for the widget as per the merchant's configuration.
### Details:
Ensure that the widget can be rendered in various specified placements on the product page.
<info added on 2025-07-13T04:27:10.498Z>
Successfully implemented placement handling logic for widget positioning:

✅ **Dynamic Placement System:**
- Added handlePlacement() method that processes placement configuration
- Implemented placement-specific CSS classes (badgr-placement-above_price, etc.)
- Added switch logic to handle different placement types: above_price, below_price, below_add_to_cart, custom

✅ **Intelligent Element Detection:**
- Created robust findPriceElement() method with theme-specific selectors (Dawn, Debut, generic)
- Added findAddToCartButton() method with comprehensive button detection
- Implemented isVisibleElement() helper to ensure elements are actually visible
- Added text content validation for add-to-cart buttons

✅ **Theme Compatibility:**
- Added specific selectors for popular Shopify themes (Dawn, Debut)
- Comprehensive fallback system for generic themes
- Proper element visibility checking to avoid hidden elements
- Intelligent text-based button detection

✅ **Safe Repositioning:**
- Implemented repositionWidget() method for DOM manipulation
- Added repositioning safety checks to prevent duplicate moves
- Proper error handling for DOM operations
- Fallback positioning when target elements aren't found

✅ **CSS Placement Styles:**
- Added placement-specific margin and spacing rules
- Mobile-responsive placement adjustments
- Custom placement support for manual positioning
- Proper visual spacing for each placement type

✅ **Placement Options Supported:**
- above_price: Positions widget above product price
- below_price: Positions widget below product price (default)
- below_add_to_cart: Positions widget below add to cart button
- custom: Allows merchant to manually position via theme editor

The placement handling system now provides intelligent, theme-aware positioning that works across different Shopify themes while maintaining visual consistency.
